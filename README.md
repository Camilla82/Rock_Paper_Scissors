This repository is part of my "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

In day 4, we were asked to create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game (player vs computer). 

What we learned with this example:
- Random module
- Lists
- Append and extract items in lists.
- Nested lists
- Index errors.
